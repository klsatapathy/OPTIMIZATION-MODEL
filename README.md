# Optimization Techniques using Python

This project demonstrates various optimization techniques implemented in Python, with practical examples in both unconstrained and constrained scenarios. It leverages mathematical foundations and Python libraries to solve problems efficiently.

## ðŸš€ Overview

Optimization is at the heart of many disciplines including data science, operations research, and engineering. This notebook explores techniques to find the best solution for a given problem â€” whether minimizing cost, maximizing profit, or fitting a model.

## ðŸ“Œ Techniques Covered

### ðŸ”¹ Unconstrained Optimization
- Gradient Descent
- Newton-Raphson Method
- Function minimization using SciPy

### ðŸ”¹ Constrained Optimization
- Lagrange Multipliers
- `scipy.optimize.minimize` with constraints
- Real-world inspired constraint-based scenarios

### ðŸ”¹ Linear Programming
- Objective functions and linear constraints
- Using `scipy.optimize.linprog` for:
  - Cost minimization
  - Resource allocation
- Constraints (inequality & equality)

### ðŸ”¹ Non-Linear Optimization
- Non-linear objective functions
- Solving with SciPy optimizers
- Example-based problem solving

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
- SciPy (`optimize`)
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## ðŸ“Š Applications

- Engineering design optimization  
- Machine learning model tuning  
- Supply chain and resource planning  
- Business decision optimization
